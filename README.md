🛡️ CypherEyes: A Hybrid Intrusion Detection System with Zero-Day Detection & Explainable AI

🚀 Overview

CypherEyes is a next-generation Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (H-IDS) designed to detect known attacks, unknown zero-day threats, insider anomalies, and provide full transparency using Explainable AI (XAI).
The system integrates signature-based detection, supervised machine learning, unsupervised anomaly models, and XAI explainability into a single real-time platform.

🧠 Why CypherEyes?

Modern networks face rapidly evolving threats:

Zero-day exploits

Insider-driven anomalies

Multi-stage intrusion attempts

Dynamic attack patterns

Traditional IDS systems fail against unknown threats and generate excessive false positives.

CypherEyes solves these challenges using a dual-layer hybrid pipeline that is robust, low-noise, and fully explainable.

⚠️ Problem Statement

Existing IDS solutions struggle with:

Detecting zero-day attacks

High false positives

Lack of reasoning behind alerts

Limited adaptability to evolving threats

There is a strong need for an accurate, low-noise, and transparent IDS.
